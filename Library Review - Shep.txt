Code Review for Shep

This class library is easy to follow and doesn't have any dead code. Your queries are
well written and straight forward so it was easy to follow along and understand the 
code. I think you could have possibliy added a few extra comments to the code maybe 
for each query to describe the data or query itself? This could be helpful for others.

Overall I think the code well writtn and clean!
