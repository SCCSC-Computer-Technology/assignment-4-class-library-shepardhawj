The sole method of this library creates a string array from a row of the database based on state name.

There are few comments, and many of the ones that exist are commenting out vestigial code. The variable
names are also not terribly descriptive. The code is still able to be followed, but may result in some
confusion for anyone who has to work with the library on a deeper level.
